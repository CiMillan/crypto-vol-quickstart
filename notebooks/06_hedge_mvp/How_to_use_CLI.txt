How to use (CLI)

From your repo root:

make deps        # installs packages into .venv (and notebook)
make kernel      # registers kernel "crypto-vol (.venv)" for Jupyter
make nb          # opens classic Jupyter Notebook (or: make nb-nosrc)

Once Notebook opens, pick kernel “crypto-vol (.venv)”	


	
For same jn logic:

“Apply the hedge_mvp narration to this new notebook.”

“Give me the per-cell explanations like last time (Markdown + LaTeX).”
